# Minesweeper

This game is made in JAVA using Linear Recursive Algorithm for high degree of randomness of play board

A novel recreation of the minesweeper game of the Microsoft Corporation is proposed. The project aims to create Minesweeper, a grid based game effectively. The strategies of its working are emulated and the structure and working of the game including the classes and key methods highlighting different approaches taken during the work are discussed keenly in this paper. Despite having many variants such as ‘Swinesweeper’ and ‘Demine’ this project solely concentrated on classic version of the game. The project is made using Java having many features that able us to utilize Linear Recursive Algorithm for high degree of randomness also other packages like java.net, javax.swing, java.awt are used for making the game quite realistic and more interesting.

To know how this game works refer the below video.
